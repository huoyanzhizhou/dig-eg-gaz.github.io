While reading The Egyptian Gazette I noticed that crime reports were frequently posted. I wanted to question what type of crimes were committed and exactly how they were executed. After searching through the newspaper I found murdering, stealing, kidnapping, and riots filled many of the cities in the 1900’s. After taking a deeper look at these reports I was able to come across some interesting findings. First off, many of the murders happened in a savagery manner. For example a man slew his victim with a knife before sunset, and after killing him, he cut his fingers and stabbed his dead body in nine different places. I also discovered that most killings were executed with a firearm, a revolver to be exact. Finally, a few of the murderers were reported showing no remorse for their victims as they were “quoting verses and asking for a cigarette before mounting the ‘gallows.” As for the punishment for these crimes, it mostly depended on the severity of offense. Punishments varied from hard labor to prison time to execution at the highest level. I also read that executions were moved from a public standpoint to happening inside the walls of the prisons. Crimes found in the 1900s are definitely contrastable to those that happen today. For instance, drug use or drug trafficking was never mentioned in the newspaper, when however, it is a daily world-wide issue in our society. However, many of the crimes reported in the newspaper are parallel to those that we might see on the news today. Shootings, stabbings, stealing, and kidnapping are all still prevalent today.
