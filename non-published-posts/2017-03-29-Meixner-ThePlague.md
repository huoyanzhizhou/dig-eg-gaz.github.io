The plague is a huge problem throughout all of Europe and most of Africa. However, the Egyptian Gazette plays it down a lot. Is this because the people of Egypt weren’t affected as much?

I found it very interesting how the issues of these newspapers only had a small section for the plague. Also, they don’t even have a section every day on the plague. Being that the plague was such a world issue at the time, it is shocking to find out it isn’t reported on more often.

The only explanation for this could be that the plague wasn’t hitting Egypt as hard as it hit Europe. In the sections on the plague in the newspaper they report the death count.

For every issue they report an average of 2 deaths. This doesn’t sound like a lot. However, 2 people dead every day in a small area is actually a rather large problem.

But then, why didn’t the Gazette make a bigger deal on this issue? I guess we will never be able to ask the publishers of the newspapers why they didn’t think it was important enough, and that is something we will just have to live with.
