In this microhistory class, I have the very unique and apparently difficult honor of transferring a newspaper from the early 1900s, to an online website. In order to do this, I have to sit in the basement of the library for hours, scanning the images of the newspaper on microfilm, and downloading them onto my computer. After I get the images on my computer, I use a program, such as Cisdem, to convert these images to an editable text document. Unfortunately, the small text from the ancient newspaper image is often unrecognizable, and is misinterpreted as being different letters than they really are. Due to this ‘small’ error, I have the pleasure of analyzing the converted document, and physically fixing each misinterpreted letter or symbol. Despite my numerous attempts of rescanning each image, and adjusting and readjusting various levels of brightness and contrast, I am still stuck with wrongly converted gibberish. Thanks to OCR, I have been spending countless hours, basically rewriting an entire newspaper, when I should just be lightly editing weather tables and advertisements.  I apologize to my classmates, my professor, as well as the rest of the population interested in reading about daily activities of people from the 1900s, for the delay.
