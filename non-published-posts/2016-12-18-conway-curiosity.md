I am curious as to why Russian ships were firing upon and sinking British ships in a time of peace and no war.  It was strange to me to find that there were ships being sank by another country, but all in a separate country from either of them.  This sinking happened in Singapore, not far from Hong Kong, but nowhere near either of the countries where the ships are from.  In 1905 apparently it was not a part of the nature of war and defense to be causing along and sink a ship they took as an enemy.

Although there were no reported deaths during this incident there was a large rescue mission that was made in order to save the lives of over 100 sailors.  The British sailors that were sank were from the British India Company part of the large scale shipping that took place in the area, and the Russian boat was simply on a patrol.
