![Newspaper Clipping of Rescued Courrier Miners](Rescued-Courrieres-Miners.png)
On Monday, April 2nd, 1906, the _Egyptian Gazette_ published the terrible tale of a group of unfortunate Courrieres miners. On March 10th, the Courrieres mining accident became the most devastating mining mishap in European history. Located a mile from the French town of Lens, the mine exploded, killing 1,099 miners. While there has been no consensus as to the initial cause of the explosion, experts speculated that a miner may have mishandled an explosive, or a lamp may have ignited methane gasses in the air.

Two thirds of the miners inside the mine at the time of explosion were killed immediately, while the others suffered the damaging effects of continual gas inhalation. By April 1st, the day before this issue was printed, only 194 bodies had been recovered. Many individuals within the surrounding mining communities accused the mine's company, _Compagnie des mines de Courrieres_ of delaying the possible rescue attempts in order to preserve the surviving coal seams from possible coalface fires induced by the suggested rescue attempts.  

As this issue's brief update states, there was a group of 13 survivors, recovered only by March 30th, a full three weeks after the initial incident. The men survived on watered-down urine and the rotting flesh of a most unfortunate mine horse. Upon their rescue, the two oldest miners, Heny and Pauvost, were awarded the Legion of Honour. The eleven others were given the Medaille d'or du courage, gold medals. Three of these survivors were younger than 18 years of age.
