The majority of my technical dificulties arised from the microfilm reader.
Once I mastered the machine I was able to properly transfer the information over to different formats.
I belive this concured due to the fact that the microfilm reader needed to be finely tuned.
At first I would come out with blurly images that were not able to be read.
This hindered my ability to properly edit it in the programs we learned to master throughout this course.
Once I progressed to transfering the text from Ads I had to be more delicate with the process.
If you happened to get it just a tad bit blurry it wouldnt work properly.
These were just some minor dificulties I came across while crafting my project.
